Goal: create a Fasta file with the C-lectin protein sequence to later blast against the S. rivoliana genome assemblies

Create a new file to input the protein sequence named benediniaGene.Fasta
```
vim benediniaGene.fasta
```

Give this file a fasta heading (>C-LECTIN) and copy the protein sequence into the file

To exit vim
  1. esc
  2. :wq
  3. Enter
