I am creating a Fasta file with the C-lectin protein sequence to later blast against the S. rivoliana genome assemblies

Steps:
1. Created a new file to input the protein sequence named benediniaGene.Fasta
  1. vim benediniaGene.fasta
2. Gave the file a fasta heading - >C-LECTIN and copied the protein sequence into the file
3. To exit vim
  1. esc
  2. :wq
  3. Enter

This successfully created a Fasta file containing the C-Lectin protein sequence
